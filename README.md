# 2buntu-Android

This project aims to provide a mobile application for the Android platform that will allow users to browse the articles on the website. This is a native application written in Java.

## Requirements

In order to build the project, you will need to install the Android SDK. I would highly recommend using Eclipse for development and testing on an actual Android device (the simulator is quite slow).
