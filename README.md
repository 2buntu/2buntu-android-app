## Build Requirements

In order to build the project, you will need to install the Android SDK. I would
highly recommend using Eclipse for development.  I would also recommend testing
on an actual Android device (the simulator is quite slow).

You will also need:

 - [Android Support Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html)
 - [Apache Common's `IOUtils`](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/apidocs/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.html).
 - [Android Universal Image Loader](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader)

Simply download the appropriate .jar files and stick them in the `libs/` directory.
