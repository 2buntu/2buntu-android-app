# 2buntu-Android

This project aims to provide a mobile application for the Android platform that
will allow users to browse the articles on the website. This is a native 
pplication written in Java.

## Requirements

In order to build the project, you will need to install the Android SDK. I would
highly recommend using Eclipse for development.  I would also recommend testing
on an actual Android device (the simulator is quite slow).

You will also need
[Apache Common's `IOUtils`](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/apidocs/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.html).
Simply download the appropriate .jar file and stick it in the `libs/` directory.
